developer
=========

Sets up my base development environment. This includes the software I like, my user and my dotfiles. I tried to make this as generic as possible.

Requirements
------------

None

Role Variables
--------------


Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
